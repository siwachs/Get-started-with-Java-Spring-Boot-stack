# pom.xml

pom.xml (Project Object Model) is the configuration file used in Maven to define:

1. Project metadata (name, version, dependencies, etc.)
2. Dependencies (libraries required for your project)
3. Build plugins (tools that help with compilation, packaging, and deployment)
4. Project structure (how the project is built)
